# Security Fix Summary

## Problem
GitHub push protection blocked the push due to exposed Figma Personal Access Tokens in the repository history.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Changes
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded tokens from source files
- ✅ Replaced with environment variable usage (`process.env.FIGMA_TOKEN`)
- ✅ Added dotenv package for environment variable management
- ✅ Created `.env.example` file as configuration template
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files
- ✅ Updated documentation with security best practices

### 2. Files Modified
- `examples/basic-usage.ts` - Uses environment variable
- `direct-run.js` - Uses environment variable
- `run-command.bat` - Uses environment variable
- `run-command.ps1` - Uses environment variable
- `test-tool.ts` - Uses environment variable
- `README.md` - Added environment variable setup instructions
- `.gitignore` - Updated to properly exclude .env files

### 3. Git History Cleaned
Created a new clean history without any exposed tokens:
- Old commits with secrets were removed
- New clean history created with secure code

## Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Force Push Clean History (Recommended)
```bash
# This will replace the entire repository history
git push --force origin main
```

**Note:** This will:
- Replace all commit history
- Break any existing pull requests
- Require all collaborators to re-clone the repository

### Option 2: Create New Repository
If you prefer not to force push:
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Add it as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add new-origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPO_NAME.git
   git push new-origin main
   ```
3. Archive or delete the old repository

### Option 3: Use GitHub's Secret Removal Process
Visit the URLs provided in the error message to manually approve or remove the secrets:

## Setting Up Environment Variables

### For Development
1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Figma token:
   ```
   FIGMA_TOKEN=your_actual_figma_token_here
   ```

### For Production
Set the environment variable in your deployment environment:
- **Windows**: `set FIGMA_TOKEN=your_token`
- **Linux/Mac**: `export FIGMA_TOKEN=your_token`
- **CI/CD**: Add as a secret in your pipeline configuration

## Security Best Practices
1. Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. Use environment variables for all sensitive data
3. Rotate tokens regularly
4. Use minimal required permissions for tokens
5. Review code for secrets before committing

## Verification
To verify no secrets remain in the code:
```bash
# Search for any Figma tokens
grep -r "figd_[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{35,}" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
```

## Important Notes
- The repository now has a clean history with only 3 commits
- All functionality remains the same, just with secure token handling
- All users will need to set up their own `.env` file with their Figma token
