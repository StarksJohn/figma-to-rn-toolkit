# Figma URLs for batch processing
# One URL per line, lines starting with # are ignored

# Example URLs (replace with your actual Figma component URLs)
https://www.figma.com/design/Wa0Oa4oeMTy5H2Tk32ooqb/CSM?node-id=13991-18999&m=dev

# Additional URLs can be added here:
# https://www.figma.com/design/YOUR_FILE_KEY/Your-Design?node-id=YOUR_NODE_ID
# https://www.figma.com/design/YOUR_FILE_KEY/Your-Design?node-id=ANOTHER_NODE_ID

# Tips:
# - Make sure the URLs are accessible with your Figma token
# - Use the 'preview' command to check components before batch generation
# - Remove or comment out URLs that are not working
